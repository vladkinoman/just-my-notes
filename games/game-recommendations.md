## Action-adventures

### Tomb Raider

The best Tomb Raider games according to [Reddit 1](reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/bew13k/whats_your_favoriteleast_favorite_tomb_raider_game/), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/52ng6r/by_far_what_is_your_favorite_tomb_raider_game/), [Reddit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/7uh7lb/best_tomb_raider_game_you_guys_played/?sort=top), [Reddit 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/454yvi/the_old_tomb_raider_games_are_really_amazing/):

- Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II: Starring Lara Croft are the best in the Original Timeline and the best in the whole franchise.
- Tomb Raider: Legend is the best one in the Legend Timeline (I wouldn't say it after the StopGame streams). Also, people say that Tomb Raider: Anniversary is great too.
- Rise of the Tomb Raider is the best game in the Survivor Timeline, it is like a perfect mix of action and puzzles. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is good, but in terms of puzzles. Tomb Raider is an action based game.

## Fightings

Here are the best fightings according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/8aodlb/best_fighting_games_of_all_time/):

- Street Fighter Alpha 2 (the worst is 1, the 3rd one is slightly bad than the 2nd one). Street Fighter Alpha II is a different series than the Street Fighter II games. The Alpha series is quite good and a lot more varied than SF2 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/61wbxe/best_version_of_sfii/).

  > SF 2 is the most important game in the series and is the mort important game in the genre. Nonetheless, people say Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the best in the series.

- Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is the best version of Street Fighter 2 (nonetheless, some people say that ST 2: Turbo is better than Super Turbo - e.g. audio). The best ways to play this game are through Hyper Street Fighter 2 for PS 2, Ultra SFII for the Switch, and the 30th Anniversary Collection for PS 3 and XBOX 360 according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/7r0n54/what_is_the_difference_between_all_the_street/).

- Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the most hyped game in the series.

- What about modern SF? Ultra Street Figher lV is the most balanced because of patches. Nonetheless, SF V is more alive game than USF4.

- X-Men Children of the Atom was very innovative, gave birth to the Marvel / Capcom games which not only popularized the tag system and the crossovers, but also created a new genre with exaggerated super powers, high jumps and easy combos which we will later see in games like Guilty Gear and similar. Marvel vs Capcom 2: probably the best MvC ever made. Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 if we want modern version.

- Tekken 3 is the best fighting of PS One epoch, Tekken 7 is currently the best in the series in terms of the gameplay and the novelty. Also, Tekken 7 is the best fighting to get into online.

- Dragon Ball series: 

  - FighterZ is objectively the best fighting game because it's designed to actually be competitive and the art/animation is freaking beautiful, but they focused more on competitive online multiplayer instead of a lengthy storymode full of unlockable characters.
  - Budokai 3 and then Tenkaichi 3. Budokai 3 was great for fast action and feeling like a very DBZish fighting game, also had a good amount of unlockables and the story stuff was quite neat because of hsow you could go back and play through it again while making changes that would lead to fighting folks like Broly or so on. Tenkaichi 3 was good primarily because of its roster size which was unrivaled at the time, not to mention characters had transformations/etc. that could be pulled off mid-match (and most of the Saiyans could transform into Great Ape forms if there was a full moon on that stage). Tenkaichi 3 has the downside in copy-paste of the many characters.

  > If you're looking for strictly a fighting game, FighterZ wins hands down. Budokai 3 is superior though if you aren't looking to play online competitive multiplayer and want to dig through story content with a lot of things to unlock.

- Soulcalibur 2.

- Mortal Kombat series according to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/ap39oc/whats_your_favourite_mortal_kombat_game/?sort=top) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/72wjg9/rank_every_mk_game/?sort=top):

  - the best is 9 (sometimes MK 11 or just MK).
  - Mortal Kombat Deception (and then Armageddon). I tried this game. It's fun, but you need to grind too much to get cool items. Although, these items could be arts or photos which is strange. This one has cool modes among among which there is Tetris, and also  The Konquest Mode, which people like.
  - MK3/UMK3/MKT - best original game.
  - MK 2.
  - MKX. Mind blowing graphics, a top notch story and awesome new characters, but those in game purchases...

- The others would be Super Smash Brother Melee and Super Smash Bros 64 (according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/459z3g/what_is_the_best_fighting_game_ever/?sort=top).

Freelancer.

> On the arcade end of the spectrum you have games like **Freelancer**, which is widely considered one of the best examples of its kind. It's solidly a 3rd person arcade shooter that just happens to take place in space. Fun story, fun gameplay, fun characters, excellent modding. Great game all around.

FreeSpace 2.

> **FreeSpace 2** is largely considered the best space combat sim ever made, and remains my favorite game of all time. While it has a very large amount of keybindings (about 4 pages worth), you only *really* need about a dozen of them and the actual gameplay is straightforward and it has a very arcade flight model. Excellent gameplay with a very interesting story. It sits in the genre of what is called a 'Military space combat sim', which is mission-based fighter pilot fare, not open world or anything. FS2 released in 1999, but the source code has been updated via FreeSpace SCP and the graphics have been overhauled significantly. Still an amazing game. Also has what is in my opinion the best and most talented modding community in PC gaming. If you're new to the genre, I'd actually start right here.

> If you have a joystick, grab a copy of Freespace and Freespace 2.
>
> 2 of the best space sim fighter games in existence
>
> You can grab both from GOG, also grab the FSOpen mod to make them look pretty.

> For mission-based, classic military style space sim? [FreeSpace 2 SCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhAR8rWPluQ). Due to probably the best modding community in existence, more than a decade after release it's still unsurpassed.

> For trade/empire-building space sim? X3.
>
> For mission-based, classic military style space sim? [FreeSpace 2 SCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhAR8rWPluQ). Due to probably the best modding community in existence, more than a decade after release it's still unsurpassed.
>
> IMO no space game since has even given you a feeling of just how insignificant you are flying a dinky little fighter beside 2-kilometre long cap ships that will vaporize you with a glancing hit from their beam cannons. The mission design departs from the typical SP game where the player is some all-important savior of mankind character, and puts you in the role of a single fighter pilot fighting in a war as part of a greater machine. You really get the sense that it doesn't matter if you live or die.. you'll just become another notch on the causality list and the war will go on without you. Someone described FreeSpace once as being the only space sim where you feel the *weight* of combat around you, and it's very true. Kind of hard to describe. The game didn't do anything revolutionary but it took the best aspects of classic 90's space sims and perfected them.

> Freespace 2 comes to mind for the story driven option. It is a combat game though.
>
> There is a mod community that not only has graphical update mods, but also some new campaigns and total conversions.

Elite Dangerous. There are a lot of recommendations on the [Vive subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/979vj5/any_space_sim_recommendations/).

> Elite: Dangerous is a free form space sim where you fly ships around, do jobs, and earn money. Basically the same premise as Elite, but with a much more intuitive interface and much better flight controls. Very similar to the Evochron games mentioned.

> The modern remake of Elite. Kind of a hybrid between X's water-space flight and a true Newtonian space sim, I'd say this is probably the one for newcomers to space sims if they want a fun and total experience.

> > Looking for an immersive space sim with lots to do, explore, and trade. Lots of NPCs to talk to and a story of some sort would be a bonus.
>
> Elite: Dangerous is fantastic. too hard for me personally as I'm currently lost somewhere around the starting system with 4 hours of fuel and don't have the slightest idea what to do.
>
> Also, there's X series and Everspace, both I think have the stuff you're looking for.

X3, X3 Terran Conflict, and X3 Albion Prelude. X4.

> You have the **X** series (of which **X4** is the latest) that is really more of a space economic sim than a true "fly spaceship sim". X4 is a solid entry to the series after X3 (X: Rebirth is terrible, avoid). The X games have a learning cliff though. And 90% of that cliff is all about managing your economic engine, not actually anything related to flying your ship.

> **X3, X3 Terran Conflict, and X3 Albion Prelude**
>
> A non-Newtonian spaceflight sim where you jump between systems using gates. You can trade and do missions for different factions. It supports the use of a joystick.
>
> > > Are there any with simple and intuitive controls? What one would you recommend for someone starting out with space sim games?
> >
> > ------
> >
> > > X3, X3 Terran Conflict, and X3 Albion Prelude
> >
> > hmmmmmmm.
> >
> > Honestly, for someone totally new, I'd probably say start with Rebel Galaxy. It doesn't have the depth of X3 or the scale of Elite Dangerous, but it's relatively easy to pick up and scratches a similar itch.
> >
> > If you pick up Rebel Galaxy and enjoy the whole "I'm a spaceship! I grind money and get upgrades and get better ships!" gameplay, then you're ready to dive into a much harder game to control. Personally I'd recommend X3, I played E:D but don't really think I had fun.

> X3, if you can make it past the interface, is still the best space sim. Haven't heard good things about X: Rebirth.
>
> It has a bit of a learning curve. Things aren't always apparent as there's a lot of icons and tiny UI elements on screen.

> If we want to get technical, Kerbal space...
>
> But as others have said X3 is excellent if you can get through the slow start, steep learning curve and insane micro management. Elite is very pretty but feels very empty right now, there's not a lot to actually do.

> Yup. X3 is the way to go. As others have said, there's a steep learning curve, and the combat is a tad dated.
>
> While the combat doesn't quite match up to the newer ED, or SC, X3 offers so much more in content that the outdated combat mechanics are hardly something to complain about. You can take it a step further and mod the game (there's a large selection of mods) to suit your tastes, while adding hundreds of hours of content.
>
> As for the other 2 big games that are always being discussed right now, ED is shallow and completely lacking in content, while SC is merely an early alpha.

> For trade/empire-building space sim? X3.

> I'll add another vote for X3. Between X3: Terran Conflict, and X3: Albion Prelude (doesn't really matter which one you play first, but I guess Albion Prelude is the 'cleanest' iteration of X3), I've clocked 500-600 hours of playtime over at least 3 different play-through attempts.
>
> One of the best aspects of the X series is that in addition to the "start with small ship, trade / fight / explore your way to bigger ship, rinse and repeat indefinitely" aspect, the X3 games allow you to build an actual intergalactic corporation filled with dozens of space stations that you own and operate.
>
> You can set-up a weapons manufacturing facility in Terran space, an illegal drugs facility in alien space, an energy production facility in another alien's space, etc. So while you're off in your ship getting into trouble, you've got your space stations producing in the background. You can even buy and automate freighter ships to conduct trade and maintain your space stations while you're away.
>
> The main downsides, I think, of the X series are the pretty steep learning curve, and how ridiculous micromanaging can get, especially the later you go in the game. After 100 hours in any of my playthroughs, I was looking at spreadsheets and menus as often as I was looking at space. Still, the best space sim games I've ever played.

> > Looking for an immersive space sim with lots to do, explore, and trade. Lots of NPCs to talk to and a sotry of some sort would be a bonus.
>
> People offhandedly have mentioned the X series but it genuinely fits your description perfectly.
>
> I'd recommend either X3: AP or X4 Foundations.
>
> I must warn you though, it has an insane learning curve. With that said, the community is super friendly and helpful and there's many resources to help you.

Evochron Legacy and Arvoch Alliance.

> On the other end of the spectrum you have games like **Evochron Legacy** and **Arvoch Alliance**, which, IMHO, are the only two space combat sims that actually do Newtonian physics even close to fun. These games are complex and a little obtuse, but have a charm that is unmatched by any other game. [I made a fairly recent vid showing some gameplay from Evochron Legacy](https://youtu.be/feICTnthipg).

> **Evochron Legacy**
> This is a spaceflight sim game with Newtonian physics, all programmed by one guy, and it's pretty impressive. Be a space trucker and fly around the galaxy doing missions.

Everspace.

Independence War 2.

Kerbel Space.

> If we want to get technical, Kerbal space is the most realistic space sim out there and its loads of fun. Docking a ship with a space station in that game is probably one of the most difficult tasks I've ever done in a video game, and it feels glorious.

> *Kerbal Space Program* is great at teaching you some basics about orbital dynamics and is a fun simulation for a (somewhat) more realistic take.

Space Rangers HD.

> This was my go to game for a long time until I found some of the newer ones. Its an old russian game, but the remaster has done it well. The ground based combat can be a bit finnicky from what I remember, but it is still fun.

Rebel Galaxy.

> Rebel Galaxy is fun, and there's a better one coming out soon, Rebel Galaxy Outlaw.

> Rebel Galaxy. A space trucking game with a rippin soundtrack (or custom ones) and Assassin Creed ship combat. Really easy to get into. It's not a 3d movement game so all action takes place on a 2d plane, but still looks good and is fun. Made by a small team.

Star Traders: Frontiers.

> There are a lot of different little things going on in this game, but it has a great trading system, which is the kind of game that I want to play. Honestly, the ship to ship combat got pretty boring after like 4 battles, but its not too terrible. It is also on IOS and Android if you want to play it on the go.

SpaceEngine.

> Space Engine is free, gorgeous, and it is possible to fly a space ship through the entire universe.
>
> > Definitely recommend giving Space Engine a try. It's not much of a game, but there is some orbital physics and exploration with ships. You can explore the entire known universe, and even more procedurally generated galaxies, all with their own stars, nebulas, planets and black holes.

Good 2D space games: 3030 Deathwar Redux, Endless Sky, Star Sector.

## Hack 'n' Slash (character action games)

- Devil May Cry:

  > But 1, 3, and 5 are all mast erpieces. 4 is just another solid game in comparison.

  - DMC5: Mechanically the best game in the series.
  - DMC3 (with 2): was genre defining, had the best story, perfect representation of the series.
  - DMC1: literally create a genre (Character action games or, to be more precise, Character Hack 'n' Slash games).
  - DMC4 - Aged better in terms of story and gameplay. Hated the fact it was rushed. 3 to 4 added onto the incredible combat and made it even more nuts. Some players over rate 4 because it was their first and that makes total and complete sense. But it has never been the best. Middle of the road game. And that's still a good thing because the DMC series is generally great.
  - DmC - Gameplay wise it's extremely fun, it just bastardizes everything else.
  - DMC2 - Ehhhh.

- Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.

- NieR:Automata.

- Ninja Gaiden Black + 2.

- Onimusha (PS2) series isn't 'pure' hack-and-slash but still has some cool melee stuff going on (and moreso as the series progressed).

- Bayonetta 2. It's just so well put together and satisfying to play.

## Immersive Sims

Many things were taken from this [source](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/313302/7_influential_immersive_sims_that_all_devs_should_play.php):

- System Shock 2 - an RPG-influenced, twisted horror playground. The systems-heavy interactivity and freedom at the core of immersive sims can just as easily be used to stifle and undermine as to liberate and empower, if paired with smart writing.
- Thief 1 & 2 - narrow-but-deep expression of the genre. Less is often more in game design; by focusing on a smaller set of ideas, systems, and verbs, Thief establishes a world dripping with detail and carefully designed around physicality — space, sound, light, dark, and movement bring depth to its relatively simple set of mechanics.
- Deus Ex - broad ambition, flexible systems, and varying situations. Consistency does not mean always offering a full suite of options, or even necessarily allowing the same solutions to always work; rather, it's in following the rules of the world, and if you're smart about it it could involve setting expectations that experimentation will be rewarded more so than rote behavior.
- Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines - a flawed but brilliant study of power fantasies. Artful use of scripting can configure and reconfigure player expectations, even in games that prize player freedom and emergence.
- Pathologic (I don't think it's an Immersive Sim).
- S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
- Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.
- Dishonored 1 & 2 - seamless possibility spaces meet masterful world building. Giving players full agency to play how they want takes two key design considerations: on the one hand, a diverse, inventive suite of tools and verbs, and on the other smart level design that allows freedom to solve problems in any way the player can imagine.
- The Long Dark.
- Prey.
- Arx Fatalis - an immersive RPG. The beating heart of an immersive sim is its world — make that feel tangible and rewarding to simply exist in and you'll have achieved much of the central ideal of the genre: the sense of immersion in one's virtual surroundings.
- Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.
- My Summer Car - the future of immersive sims. Immersive sims don't need to have sci fi or fantasy themes; they can be set just as easily in the life of an unextraordinary person in decidedly ordinary circumstances.

Some other games have Immersive Sim components too: Hitman Blood Money (with 1st person), Metal Gear Solid V (with its AI system), Fallout New Vegas (with its 1st person view and hardcore mode), Second DLC of Bioshock Infinite, TES Morrowind (occasionally).

> An immersive sim can be anything so long as it's consistent and reactive and its world feels alive.

## Metroidvania

### Castelvania

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/castlevania/comments/96ldav/what_are_the_essential_castlevania_games_that_i/) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/castlevania/comments/8ehgo1/what_are_your_personal_top_10_castlevania_games/):

- Castlevania 4: Symphony of the Night - revived the series and spawned a new genre known as Metroidvania games. Players assume the role of Alucard, as you explore Dracula’s Castle in order to find and defeat him. No longer are whips the weapon of choice, as swords and shields have taken over, along with magic and and the ability to transform into mist, wolves and bats. Explore the beautifully-detailed non-linear castle – right side up or inverted.
- Rondo of Blood - probably the best game in the entire series
- Aria of Sorrow - one of the best stories and gameplay.

### Metroid

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1rwsx8/how_would_you_rank_the_games_best_to_worst/) and [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/9gcby0/what_are_your_top_5_metroid_games/):

- Super Metroid.
- Metroid: Prime (some people say that Prime 2 is better than the first one because it is more polished).

## Platforms

### Donkey Kong

According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6vcx5r/whats_your_favorite_donkey_kong_game_from_the/):

- Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.
- Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze.

### Mario

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6a080g/super_mario_games_what_are_your_alltime_rankings/), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7y3sjd/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_mario_game_and_why/?sort=top):

- Super Mario World is still the best among the 2D games.
- Super Mario Bros. 3.
- Super Mario 64 - It was a super creative transition into 3D gaming.
- The others would be Galaxy 1 and 2 (the second is slightly better than the first one but both are the best among 3D), classic Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Odyssey.

### Mega Man

According to [Reddit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/9l4jgs/what_is_the_best_mega_man_game_in_2018/?sort=top), [Reddit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/9mlkkp/what_is_the_best_mega_man_game_out_of_the_entire/?sort=top), [Reddit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/aahasi/what_do_you_think_is_the_best_mega_man_game/), and [Reddit 4](reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/8tlvvq/is_it_worth_playing_every_megaman_game/?sort=top):

>Most of the series is pretty redundant. I’d say start at Mega Man 2, 7, X and X4.

- **Mega Man 2** and Mega Man 3 are wildly considered the best of the original series (especially 2). I tried them and must admit that they have annoying backgrounds. Don't pick 3 to start with. It's a good game but it's Incredibly hard and Longer than the other classic games. Also among them, people still distinguish Mega Man 7 (how many of them :().

- **Mega Man X** is the best of the X series. The original Mega Man X was remade on the PlayStation Portable as Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X. On December 21, 2011, another remake of Mega Man X was released for download on the iPhone and iPad. X2 and X4 are good too, but someone thinks X4 is *the* best in that series and in the franchise as a whole.

  > If you like X, then I highly recomment X2 - 4 as well (4 has some terrible voice work, but also some fantastic gameplay.)

- Mega Man Zero is the hardest Mega Man series, the gameplay is similar to X but more fast and fluid, it has a very interesting plot and a conclusion, the music is top tier. 1 and 2 are especially worth it. Mega Man Zero 3 for story. 

### Sonic

Classic:

- Sonic the Hedgehog 1
- Sonic the Hedgehog 2 - Sega’s answer to Mario, Sonic arrive to to carry the Genesis brand name. While the original Sonic and its second sequel, Sonic 3, were fantastic games in their own right, the blue Hedgehog’s best adventure was his second go-around. Dazzling speed with beautifully rich and colourful levels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 pits the titular character and his companion Tails against the evil Dr. Robotnik. Make sure to collect enough rings to enter the special stages, allowing you to transform into Super Sonic.

## Role-playing games

### Chrono Trigger

Mixing epic RPG action and time travel, Chrono Trigger is one of the best and most popular games on the SNES as well as one of the greatest RPG’s of all time. With a complex story revolving around your group of heroes jumping from one time period to the next trying to stop the apocalypse, Chrono Trigger presented amazing aesthetics, a fantastic musical score, endearing characters, an innovative battle system, multiple endings and even a major character’s death – we won’t say who, but it was unheard of at the time.

### Ni no Kuni

> This is one of the best anime games according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/brovbl/good_anime_games/).

- Ni no Kuni 1 - the art style is by Studio Ghibli and it is an awesome RPG with some Pokémon like aspects too where you collect and evolve familiars.
- Ni no Kuni 2 is less cool than the first but it has more abilities to build your army.

### The Legend of Zelda

Here are the best The Legend of Zelda games:

- The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time. The best way to play this game is through Nintendo 3DS. You can use Citra emulator in order to do this but it isn't that stable. Nonetheless, people say that OoT runs well on this emulator. The other way to play this game is to use the latest Project64 with the [GLideN64](http://www.emucr.com/2016/10/gliden64-git-20161016.html) plugin upscaled and played with true unstretched [widescreen](http://i.imgur.com/EEe7Wrx.jpg), it also supports high res textures [[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/5ajs18/best_way_to_play_emulated_ocarina_of_time_in_2016/?sort=top)].
- The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The biggest flaw of Majora's Mask is that the game has to be played on time.
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is the best game for Switch.
- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.

Also, A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening are awesome. 

>  Link's Awakening was recommended by Frankie Ward. I think she played its remake on Switch.

### Persona

> This is one of the best anime games according to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/brovbl/good_anime_games/).

According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/9mbj87/whats_the_general_consensus_on_best_persona_game/):

- Persona 3 - 5 and 3 are a tie. The story of 3 is better, thematically strong, good characters who all get a fair amount of screen time. Persona 5 is a better **game** but not worth replaying. Persona 3 FES is honestly better than PSP version. 
  P3P has the Female MC option to give you something new to do if you're already done all the social links with the Male MC. Battling is better in P3P since you can control all your party members. Outside battles and dungeons P3P is more of a visual novel style. You don't run around town, you just move a cursor. P3P doesn't have the animated cutscenes. P3P doesn't have the Answer included with it like FES does, but the Answer is boring anyway. The best way to experience it is through youtube for some story-line closure. The best way to play is with P3P while watching the animated cutscenes on youtube.
- Persona 5 and Persona 2. 5 has the worst story but amazing gameplay and characters though they don't get any worthwhile development. Overall, the game is solid tho. 2 has meh gameplay but that story. And all the characters are amazing too.

### Pokemon

After googling I find out that the best Pokémon games (for me) are a pair of core series Generation III games that are set in the Kanto region (the first region - classic):

- Pokémon FireRed / LeafGreen versions - are the enhanced remakes to the original Japanese Pokémon games (Red and Green) for the Game Boy Advance. While Fire Red was a remake of Pokémon Red, LeafGreen was a remake of the Japan-only Pokémon Green. Pokémon Green had previously been a Japan exclusive, being replaced by Pokémon Blue in the US. Regardless, the Green remake was chosen for the US editions [[WIKI]([https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Pokémon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen))]. Yeah, this is hard!!! :laughing:
- Other great Pokémon games are Pokémon HeartGold/ SoulSilver.

## Strategies

- Heroes of Might & Magic 3.

- Anno 1404 and then Anno 2070 (feels like an ultra-polished version of 1404). Nice comments are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/andnkq/how_would_you_rank_all_the_anno_games_and_why/). Some people say that Anno 1800 is actually pretty good and can be a nice modern Anno experience.

- Civilization 4 (maybe with DLC, maybe without them.) and then Civilization 5 (with expansions!) - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/35wfzm/what_are_your_top_5_strategy_games_of_all_time/).

- Age of Empires 2.

- Rome: Total War and then Medieval II: Total War.

- World in Conflict. 

  > This is one of the few games I kept playing for its story. It assumes that the cold war got hot and the Soviet Union invaded the USA. At first this sounds kinda cliché and dull imo, but it was very well presented and actually thrilling to see how things unfold.

- Command & Conquer: Red Alert and Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn.

- Starcraft 1-2. Some people say Warcraft (especially the 3rd one) > Starcraft.

- Age of Mythology - my own first strategy video game <3

Also Settlers were great! Settlers 2 and 3 were the best in the series. 4 is the best game if we want more modern gameplay.
